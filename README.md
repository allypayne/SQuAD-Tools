some of the code I have been implementing for work over the summer

# Plots for the Poster
If you want to create a draft plot with our data you can do so with the make_plot function within my script titled "detections"
You should first create a data set using "detections" for either the HI or OVI the detections and another data set for the OVI detections. You will then need to create a "non detections" data set using the same script file. This are both required parameters for the make_plot function. With these tools you can create draft plots that we are using in our upcoming poster!
Start by adjusting the color bar (and corresponding titles); ideas for these plots include: sqrt_M_tot_OVI, sqrt_M_tot_HI, H_I_total_log10_N, O_VI_total_log10_N

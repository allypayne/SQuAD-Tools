# SQuAD-Tools
Some of the code that's been implemented for work over the summer. This file serves as a roadmap to the other tools in this directory and the meaning of each.

# First Step
Before doing anything with these tools you will need data! Download the file "galfit_spectral_refined_table_for_kirill_w_bval_3.csv" from the WS Google Drive to get started.

# PlotGuidelines 
Read PlotGuidelines [here](/PlotGuidelines.md)

Refer to this file to gain an understanding of detections/ non detections and how to create draft plots that are used for analysis.

# Detections.py
Download it [here](/detections.py)

Store this in the same directory as the notebook you are working in and use the functions to sort data and create plots.
